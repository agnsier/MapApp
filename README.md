## How to start Map App.

To use application you need to have access token for Mapbox Map. <br/>
See how to get one -> (https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/access-token/). <br/>
Paste access token to /src/access_token.js file. <br/>
Without access token application won't work.

First install all dependencies with:
## `npm install`

Then run Map Web App with: 

### `npm start`

App is running in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
